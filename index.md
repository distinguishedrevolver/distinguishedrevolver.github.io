Many Precision Pistol shooters report having a hard time making accurate .38 Special 158 gr. lead ammunition in order to practice for, and compete in, the NRA Distinguished Revolver and the new (2022) CMP Service Revolver event. The NRA rules previously (before 2018 or so) specified "lead ammunition only," however, now the rules don't enumerate anything more than:

"3.3 (e)  Ammunition -  Any  safe  .38  caliber  ammunition  using  the  158 grain round nose or Semi-Wadcutter bullet only."

With the rule change, it is presumably possible to now use a load with a jacketed bullet; the idea being that more accuracy could be achieved in doing so.

In the newly introduced CMP Service Revolver event, the rules for ammunition state:

"4.4.3 Service Revolver Ammunition - CMP Service Revolver competitors may fire any safe, single projectile ammunition." There are some restrictions to caliber; revolvers may be chambered from 9mm/38 Special to 45 caliber, per rule 4.1.7 (b). So, 32 S&W Long need not apply, even though it was a service round for NYPD during Teddy Rosevelt's time as police commissioner.

Regardless of the NRA rule change & ambiguity around jacketed ammunition, this site is mostly concerned with lead bullets, swaged or cast, that will work for both NRA and CMP events. Naturally, as I am unable to be responsible for your loading practices, nor of the possibility of error in text, it is solely your responsibility and liability to check that you follow best reloading practices.

What powder, what case, what bullet, etc. are all questions that frequently arise in the course of building an accurate load. To make matters even more difficult, not all revolvers are created equal, and it is often said that what works in one may very well not work in another. Lastly, some revolvers just struggle to shoot, no matter what you do.

Here, I'll attempt to dispel myths, share load data, and provide evidence
for what appear to be accurate loads to help cut load your development time down considerably.
