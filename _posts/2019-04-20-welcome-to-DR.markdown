Many Precision Pistol shooters have a hard time making accurate .38 Special 158
gr. lead ammunition for the NRA Distinguished Revolver event. What powder, what
case, what bullet, etc. are all questions that frequently arise in the course
of building an accurate load. To make matters even more difficult, not all
revolvers are created equal, and so what works in one may very well not work in
another, it is often said.

Strange, though, that many believe factory ammunition
to be a great source of accuracy, which immediately goes against all lore and
narrative of most reloading shooters; i.e. that they alone can make better and
more accurate ammunition than the factory.

Here, I'll attempt to dispel myths, provide load data, and provide evidence
for what appear to be significantly well understood and broadly accepted
accurate loads to help cut load development time down considerably.
