Sgt. Jason Gregoire, of the [Army Marksmanship Unit](https://www.goarmy.com/army-marksmanship-unit.html) (located at Ft. Moore, GA), is the 2023 Georgia State Match Pistol Champion & Match Winner, and also won the CMP Service Revolver match at the 2023 National Trophy Pistol Match & CMP Championships at Camp Perry, OH.

Additionally, he is a CMP Distinguished 22, Service Pistol, Service Revolver and Air Pistol shooter, along with having earned his Distinguished Revolver badge from the NRA. In addition to being in the 2600 Club of both the NRA and CMP, he was the [Presidents 100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President%27s_Hundred_Tab) match winner in 2022.

Jason, having the heart of both a true competitor and teacher, was kind enough to video, in profile, his technique for shooting timed and rapid strings using his revolver. The video is below:

A couple of points to note:

<ol>
  <li>In order to make ready for his next round, you'll note how quickly he moves his trigger finger away from the trigger after recoil.</li>
  <li>Watch the move he makes at the backstrap when he is manipulating the hammer between shots.</li>
</ol>

Thanks to Jason for sharing his technique!
